The CMS Open Data is based on 31.8/pb of 7 TeV proton-proton collisions recorded at the Large Hadron Collider in 2010, yielding a sample of 768,687 events containing a high-quality central jet with transverse momentum larger than 85 GeV. Using CMS's particle flow reconstruction algorithm to obtain jet constituents, we extract the 2-prong substructure of the leading jet using soft drop declustering. We find good agreement between results obtained from the CMS Open Data and those obtained from parton shower generators, and we also compare to analytic jet substructure calculations performed to modified leading-logarithmic accuracy. Although the 2010 CMS Open Data does not include simulated data to help estimate systematic uncertainties, we use track-only observables to validate these substructure studies.",

In this study, we use low-level detector information from the simulated CMS Open Data samples to construct the top jet classifiers. To optimize classifier performance we progressively add low-level information from the CMS tracking detector, including pixel detector reconstructed hits and impact parameters, and demonstrate the value of additional tracking information even when no new spatial structures are added. Relying only on calorimeter energy deposits and reconstructed pixel detector hits, the end-to-end classifier achieves an AUC score of 0.975$\\pm$0.002 for the task of classifying boosted top quark jets.

Applying dimuon pT cuts of 25 GeV and 60 GeV, we explore two overlapping samples: one with isolated muons, and one with prompt muons without an isolation requirement. Using the latter sample requires information about detector effects and QCD backgrounds, which we obtain directly from the CMS Open Data. We present model-independent limits on the product of cross section, branching fraction, acceptance, and efficiencies. These limits are stronger, relative to a corresponding inclusive search without a pT cut, by factors of as much as nine. Our \"pT-enhanced\" dimuon search strategy provides improved sensitivity to models in which a new particle is produced mainly in the decay of something heavier, as could occur, for example, in decays of the Higgs boson or of a TeV-scale top partner.

Further, these rankings based on data are robust to the estimate of the mixture fraction in the test set.

We probe the feasibility of such measurements using approximately 0.2 inverse femtobarns of data which was recorded in 2012 by the CMS collaboration and made public within the CMS Open Data initiative. In particular, we test an inclusive three-jet event selection which is primarily sensitive to non-standard parity violating effects in quark-gluon interactions. Within our measurements, no significant deviation from the Standard Model is seen and no obvious experimental limitations have been found. We discuss other ways that searches for non-standard parity violation could be performed, noting that these would be sensitive to very different sorts of models to those which our measurements constrain.

The time-varying nature of dark mediator mass exhibits a double-peak spectrum, reducing traditional constraints by 1 to 2 orders of magnitude, due to decreased luminosity exposure in each resonant mass bin.

We define two non-overlapping samples via a pseudorapidity cut -- central jets with |eta| < 0.65 and forward jets with |eta| > 0.65 -- and employ jet topic modeling to extract individual distributions for the maximally separable categories. Under certain assumptions, such as sample independence and mutual irreducibility, these categories correspond to \"quark\" and \"gluon\" jets, as given by a recently proposed operational definition. We consider a number of different methods for extracting reducibility factors from the central and forward datasets, from which the fractions of quark jets in each sample can be determined. The greatest stability and robustness to statistical uncertainties is achieved by a novel method based on parametrizing the endpoints of a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. To mitigate detector effects, which would otherwise induce unphysical differences between central and forward jets, we use the OmniFold method to perform central value unfolding. As a demonstration of the power of this method, we extract the intrinsic dimensionality of the quark and gluon jet samples, which exhibit Casimir scaling, as expected from the strongly-ordered limit. To our knowledge, this work is the first application of full phase space unfolding to real collider data, and one of the first applications of topic modeling to extract separate quark and gluon distributions at the LHC.",

We perform this analysis to search for compressed and long-lived top partners in the 8 TeV CMS Open Data events with the integrated luminosity of 11.6 fb$^{-1}$ and obtain new limits. With 15-30 GeV mass splitting between the top partner and the DM candidate, we exclude the top partner mass below 350 GeV, which is more stringent than the ATLAS and CMS results using 8 TeV data with 20 fb$^{-1}$ luminosity.

        "abstract": "At high energy physics experiments, processing billions of records of structured numerical data from collider events to a few statistical summaries is a common task. The data processing is typically more complex than standard query languages allow, such that custom numerical codes are used. At present, these codes mostly operate on individual event records and are parallelized in multi-step data reduction workflows using batch jobs across CPU farms. Based on a simplified top quark pair analysis with CMS Open Data, we demonstrate that it is possible to carry out significant parts of a collider analysis at a rate of around a million events per second on a single multicore server with optional GPU acceleration. This is achieved by representing HEP event data as memory-mappable sparse arrays of columns, and by expressing common analysis operations as kernels that can be used to process the event data in parallel. We find that only a small number of relatively simple functional kernels are needed for a generic HEP analysis. The approach based on columnar processing of data could speed up and simplify the cycle for delivering physics results at HEP experiments. We release the \\texttt{hepaccelerate} prototype library as a demonstrator of such methods.",

Inspired by an ongoing search for dark mesons at the ATLAS experiment, CMS open data is used for this proof-of-concept intentionally targeting an already excluded signal. Several signal regions are defined based on density estimates of signal and background. These preliminary regions align well with the physical properties of the signal while effectively rejecting background events. While not explored in this work, this method is also scalable, which makes it ideal for large datasets such as those expected at the high-luminosity upgrade of the LHC. Finally, this method is flexible and can be easily extended, promising a boost to the signal region definition process for new physics searches at colliders.",

        "abstract": "Distinguishing between quark- and gluon-initiated jets is a critical and challenging task in high-energy physics, pivotal for improving new physics searches and precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider. While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has advanced jet tagging using image-based representations, the potential of Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures, renowned for modeling global contextual information, remains largely underexplored for direct calorimeter image analysis, especially under realistic detector and pileup conditions. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of ViTs and ViT-CNN hybrid models for quark-gluon jet classification using simulated 2012 CMS Open Data. We construct multi-channel jet-view images from detector-level energy deposits (ECAL, HCAL) and reconstructed tracks, enabling an end-to-end learning approach. Our comprehensive benchmarking demonstrates that ViT-based models, notably ViT+MaxViT and ViT+ConvNeXt hybrids, consistently outperform established CNN baselines in F1-score, ROC-AUC, and accuracy, highlighting the advantage of capturing long-range spatial correlations within jet substructure. This work establishes the first systematic framework and robust performance baselines for applying ViT architectures to calorimeter image-based jet classification using public collider data, alongside a structured dataset suitable for further deep learning research in this domain.",

        "abstract": "The remarkably high energies of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have allowed for the first measurements of the shapes and scalings of multi-point correlators of energy flow operators, $\\langle \u03a8| \\mathcal{E}(\\vec n_1) \\mathcal{E}(\\vec n_2) \\cdots \\mathcal{E}(\\vec n_k) |\u03a8\\rangle$, providing new insights into the Lorentzian dynamics of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In this Letter, we use recent advances in effective field theory to derive a rigorous factorization theorem for the light-ray density matrix, $\u03c1= |\u03a8\\rangle \\langle \u03a8|$, inside high transverse momentum jets at the LHC. Using the light-ray operator product expansion, the scaling behavior of multi-point correlators can be computed from the expectation value of the twist-2 spin-$J$ light-ray operators, $\\mathbb{O}^{[J]}$, in this state, $\\text{Tr}[ \u03c1~\\mathbb{O}^{[J]} ]$. We compute the light-ray density matrix at next-to-leading order, and combine this with results for the next-to-leading logarithmic scaling behavior of the correlators up to six-points, comparing with CMS Open Data. This theoretical accuracy allows us to resolve the quantum scaling dimensions of QCD light-ray operators inside jets at the LHC. Our factorization theorem for the light-ray density matrix at the LHC completes the link between recent developments in the study of energy correlators and LHC phenomenology, opening the door to a wide variety of precision jet substructure studies.",

        "abstract": "A search is performed for pairs of light pseudoscalar bosons (a) produced from decays of the 125 GeV Higgs boson ($\\text{h}_{125}$). The analysis is based on publicly available data collected in 2016 by the CMS experiment at the LHC in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. The amount of data analyzed corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 16.4 $\\text{fb}^{-1}$. The analysis explores for the first time at the LHC the final state exhibiting two muons and two c-quarks, which originate from flavor-asymmetric decays of the pseudoscalar pair. The search probes the pseudoscalar boson mass interval comprised between 4 and 11 GeV, which represents a region where the light bosons exhibit a considerable Lorentz boost, and thus their decay products overlap. No significant deviation from the standard model expectation is observed. Model-independent upper limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the cross section and branching fraction for the ${\\text{h}_{125} \\rightarrow \\text{a}\\text{a} \\rightarrow \u03bc^{-}\u03bc^{+} c\\bar{c}}$ process relative to the standard model Higgs boson production cross section, reaching a minimum value close to $3.3 \\times 10^{-4}$. The results are interpreted in the context of two Higgs doublets plus singlet models and compared to existing experimental results covering other decay channels. The exclusion limits obtained by this search improve the current constraints set by various LHC searches in scenarios where the coupling of the light boson to up-type quarks is enhanced.",

        "abstract": "The microscopic dynamics of particle collisions is imprinted into the statistical properties of asymptotic energy flux, much like the dynamics of inflation is imprinted into the cosmic microwave background. This energy flux is characterized by correlation functions $\\langle \\mathcal{E}(\\vec n_1)\\cdots \\mathcal{E}(\\vec n_k) \\rangle$ of energy flow operators $ \\mathcal{E}(\\vec n)$. There has been significant recent progress in studying energy flux, including the calculation of multi-point correlation functions and their direct measurement inside high-energy jets at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). In this paper, we build on these advances by defining a notion of \"celestial non-gaussianity\" as a ratio of the three-point function to a product of two-point functions. We show that this celestial non-gaussianity is under perturbative control within jets at the LHC, allowing us to cleanly access the non-gaussian interactions of quarks and gluons. We find good agreement between perturbative calculations of the non-gaussianity and a charged-particle-based analysis using CMS Open Data, and we observe a strong non-gaussianity peaked in the \"flattened triangle\" regime. The ability to robustly study three-point correlations is a significant step in advancing our understanding of jet substructure at the LHC. We anticipate that the celestial non-gaussianity, and its generalizations, will play an important role in the development of higher-order parton showers simulations and in the hunt for ever more subtle signals of potential new physics within jets.",

        "abstract": "In recent years, energy correlators have emerged as a powerful tool for studying jet substructure, with promising applications such as probing the hadronization transition, analyzing the quark-gluon plasma, and improving the precision of top quark mass measurements. The projected $N$-point correlator measures correlations between $N$ final-state particles by tracking the largest separation between them, showing a scaling behavior related to DGLAP splitting functions. These correlators can be analytically continued in $N$, commonly referred to as $\u03bd$-correlators, allowing access to non-integer moments of the splitting functions. Of particular interest is the $\u03bd\\to 0$ limit, where the small momentum fraction behavior of the splitting functions requires resummation. Originally, the computational complexity of evaluating $\u03bd$-correlators for $M$ particles scaled as $2^{2M}$, making it impractical for real-world analyses. However, by using recursion, we reduce this to $M 2^M$, and through the FastEEC method of dynamically resolving subjets, $M$ is replaced by the number of subjets. This breakthrough enables, for the first time, the computation of $\u03bd$-correlators for LHC data. In practice, limiting the number of subjets to 16 is sufficient to achieve percent-level precision, which we validate using known integer-$\u03bd$ results and convergence tests for non-integer $\u03bd$. We have implemented this in an update to FastEEC and conducted an initial study of power-law scaling in the perturbative regime as a function of $\u03bd$, using CMS Open Data on jets. The results agree with DGLAP evolution, except at small $\u03bd$, where the anomalous dimension saturates to a value that matches the BFKL anomalous dimension.",
